## Rewrite the Template

>Most developer positions involve reading other's code and rewriting it. This template was last updated in 2014, so there was lots of sprucing up to do! I first began with adding a scrollTo event when the user clicks the navbar links. Next, I removed the projects section to incorporate Bootstrap Modals. I used an object to dynamically update the information in the single modal. 

>The contact form was out of date, and was missing some validation elements. I added the check for white space in the jqBootstrapValidation plugin, which is also an outdated project. I used a phpMailer file for the contact form. 

>The final touches were changing the CSS to emphasize myself as a developer. This portfolio represents the type of developer I am: consise, thorough, and creative.
